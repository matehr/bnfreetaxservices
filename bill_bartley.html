		<p>Bill Bartley was and forever will be Mr. VITA.  He began volunteering to prepare tax returns in 2002 becoming a site manager in 2005.  As a retired volunteer, he had a lot of time and zeal to devote to expanding the availability of free tax preparation to the Bloomington-Normal community.  In 2011 when our sponsoring organization reduced their scope, Bill initiated and created the Bloomington Normal VITA Foundation non-profit. He served as its first President until 2019 and continued to volunteer until 2023.</p>
		<p>Bill had an impact on nearly every volunteer to pass through VITA.  Many of us were recruited directly by Bill and even more were mentored and supported by him as they learned more about the process.  Bill passed down his vast knowledge of tax law, love for the clients, and desire to serve, which will ensure the continued success of VITA long after his departure.  We will deeply miss his leadership and will always remember his labor to make our community a better place.</p>
		<p>A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. Oct. 12 at St. John’s Lutheran Church in Bloomington.  His full obituary can be found at <a href="https://calvertmemorial.com/obituaries/william-bartley">Calvert & Metzler Funeral Home</a>.  Donations to the VITA Foundation can be made via <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=XJ5WEFB8JTGTU">Paypal</a>.</p>
