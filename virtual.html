				<h2>What is Virtual VITA?</h2>
				<p>Virtual VITA is a 100% online option for working with us to complete your tax return. Under this program, our trained volunteers will still prepare your return and e-file it for free, however you will not meet us as one of our physical sites.  Using this option will require you to be comfortable using technology to meet with us online, upload your tax documents to our secure server, and electronically sign your return.</p>
				<h2>How does the process work?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>You start by booking an intake appointment using our <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/VirtualVita1@bnfreetaxservices.org/bookings/"><b>ONLINE SCHEDULER</b></a>.  Appointment days and times vary based on volunteer availability, and are only available 7 days in advance.</li>
					<li>You will receive a confirmation email after you book an appointment.  That email will contain links to 2 forms that you need to download and fill out.</li>
					<li>You will receive a second email with your personal link to our secure server.  Using that link you will upload the documents you filled out, along with a picture of your government ID, your social security card, and all of your tax documents.  This means that you need to be able to either scan these items, or take a picture of them.</li>
					<li>At your scheduled appointment time you will join a Microsoft Teams meeting, where you will verify your identity, and go over all your tax documents with one of our volunteers. The link to join this meeting is contained in your appointment confirmation email.</li>
					<li>Our volunteers will then prepare your return, and reach back out to you to schedule a second meeting after your return is complete.</li>
					<li>The second meeting will also take place using Microsoft Teams.  During this meeting you will review your tax return with a volunteer.</li>
					<li>After the meeting is over you will receive a link from PandaDoc which will direct you to an online signing session.  If you are filing a joint return, both the taxpayer and the spouse must separately sign the return.  <b>Each signer is REQUIRED to have their own email address</b></li>
					<li>Once all required signatures have been obtained, you will receive a password protected, encrypted email that contains your final copy of your return.  Your return will then be e-filed.  It is important to note that we cannot e-file your return until all the steps in the process have been completed.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Why are there no appointments available?</h2>
				<p>Virtual appointments must be scheduled at least 24 hours in advance, but cannot be scheduled more than 7 day in advance. (This is different than the booking window for our physical sites) Our first appointments will be on Feb 1, so you will not be able to book an appointment until January 25 at the earliest.</p>
				<p>Additionally, the virtual VITA program is not operating on a fixed schedule.  Volunteers enter their availability into the system, which then opens up appointments.  If you don't see an appointment time that works for you, check back again another time as volunteers will continue to open appointment blocks on a rolling basis.</p>
