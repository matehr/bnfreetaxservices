					<h2>Our Volunteers</h2>
					<p>
						All of our volunteer tax preparers have been certified in tax law by the IRS.  Our volunteers come from a variety of backgrounds, but all share a common desire to use their time and talents to give back to their community.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>How to get involved</h2>
					<p>
  					   There are several different roles that our volunteers take on throughout the tax season.  Some of our volunteers are greeters and intake coordinators, others are tax preparers, and others yet are quality reviewers.
					</p>
					<p>If you are interested in any or all of these positions, you can find a more detailed description at the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/IRS-Tax-Volunteers">IRS VITA volunteer page</a>.  If you would like to become a volunteer with
					the Bloomington Normal VITA Foundation please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@bnfreetaxservices.org">info@bnfreetaxservices.org</a>.  
					</p>
					<p>
					Free volunteer classroom training courses are available in January of each year, and online training is available throughout
					the tax season.
