					<h2>Our Volunteers</h2>
					<p>
						All of our volunteer tax preparers have been certified in tax law by the IRS.  Our volunteers come from a variety of backgrounds, but all share a common desire to use their time and talents to give back to their community.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>How to get involved</h2>
					<p>
  					   There are several different roles that our volunteers take on throughout the tax season.  Some of our volunteers are greeters and intake coordinators, others are tax preparers, and others yet are quality reviewers.
					</p>
					<p>If you are interested in any or all of these positions, you can find a more detailed description at the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/IRS-Tax-Volunteers">IRS VITA volunteer page</a>.  If you would like to become a volunteer with
					the Bloomington Normal VITA Foundation please contact us at <a href="mailto:bnfreetaxservices@gmail.com">bnfreetaxservices@gmail.com</a>.  
					</p>
					<!--<p>
					Free volunteer classroom training courses are available in January of each year, and online training is available throughout
					the tax season.
					</p>-->
					<p>Classroom training will not be available this year due to COVID-19.  Online training is available throughout the tax season.</p>

					<h3>New This Year</h3>
					<p>In addition to the Basic and Advanced exams, a new exam called the Qualified Experienced Volunteer (QEV) exam is available.  This exam is shorter than the Advanced exam and qualifies you to prepare returns at the advanced level.  In order to qualify to use this exam, you must have certified at the Advanced level in 2020 (for 2019 tax returns).  Additionally, the QEV exam does NOT qualify for CE credits.  You must take the Advanced exam if you wish to recieve CE credits.</p>
					<p>Printed 4012 and text booklets are available.  Returning volunteers can reach out to Bill or Matt to obtain a copy.
					<p>Online training and testing is not available yet. Information will be posted here when it is available.</p>
					<p>The board has been busy meeting and planning all summer long. COVID-19 is obviously going to have a very significant impact on how we operate this year.  We have been developing a plan for how our sites can modify their operations based on all current information.  Since this situation is continually evolving, specific details will be shared via email at this time, and will be posted to this site closer to the start of tax season.</p>
					<!--<p>To access the online certification test volunteers should go to:  <a href="http://www.linklearncertification.com/">http://www.linklearncertification.com/</a> and set up an account.  The 2018 online training is now available and can be found <a href="https://apps.irs.gov/app/vita/choose_path.jsp">here</a>.  Hard copies of the test will be available during the training sessions, however we do not expect to have printed copies of pub 4012 until early February. It is available online however. We will be using TaxSlayer software again this year.  To start practicing with the new software you can use this <a href="https://vita.taxslayerpro.com/irstraining">link</a>.
