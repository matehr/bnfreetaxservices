				<h1>COVID-19 Updates</h1>
				<div class="section">
					<p>We plan to open sites at Bloomington Housing Authority, Heartland Community College, and the Normal Activity and Recreation Center.  Heartland Community College will be in the <b>Normal Readiness Center</b>.  This is a new building for us.  For the Bloomington Housing Authority, please use the east side entrance.</p>
					<p>There are several important changes to note this year:</p>
					<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
						<li>All sites will operate with a <b>drop-off/pick-up model by appointment only</b>.  There will be <b>no walk-ins</b> and <b>no in-person waiting</b>.</li>  
						<li><b>All sites will require an appointment</b> to drop off your tax information. Appointments can be made starting January 19, no more than 3 weeks in advance.  You will be contacted to make another appointment to pick up your completed return.</b>
						<ul>
							<li>Appointments for <b>Bloomington Housing Authority</b> and <b>Heartland Community College</b> can be made at <a href="www.bnfreetaxservices.org">www.bnfreetaxservices.org</a> or by calling </b>309-830-4832</b>.</li>   
							<li>Appointments for <b>Normal ARC</b> can be made by calling <b>309-888-9099</b>.</li>  
						</ul>
					<li>Please <b>fill out an <a href="http://bnfreetaxservices.org/documents/f13614c.pdf">intake interview form</a> <u>before</u> your appointment</b> to minimize the length of your drop-off appointment.  Please also bring a photo id, social security cards/ITIN for all individuals on your return, all tax documents (W2, 1099-R, etc.), a copy of last year’s tax return if available, and your bank account number/routing information for direct deposit.</li>
					<li>We will offer limited virtual appointments for those who cannot physically visit a site. This option will require the ability to video chat and upload files electronically. For more information on how to use this option, please visit our website in mid-January.</li>
				</ul>
 
				<p>Safety Measures When Visiting a Site:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A <b>properly worn face covering</b> will be required for clients and volunteers.</li>
					<li>Social distancing will be implemented. To facilitate this, <b>we ask that you do not bring anyone with you to your appointment who is not required to be there</b>.</li>
					<li>If you or anyone in your household has <b>COVID-19 symptoms</b>, we ask that you contact us at info@bnfreetaxservices.org to <b>reschedule</b> your appointment or call us.</li>
