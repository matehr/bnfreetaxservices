				<h3>FAQs about the economic relief package</h3>
				<b>I am not typically required to file a tax return. Can I still receive my payment?</b>
				<p>Yes. People who typically do not file a tax return will need to file a simple tax return to receive an economic impact payment. Low-income taxpayers, senior citizens, Social Security recipients, some veterans and individuals with disabilities who are otherwise not required to file a tax return will not owe tax.</p>
				<b>How can I file the tax return needed to receive my economic impact payment?</b>
				<p><a href="IRS.gov/coronavirus">IRS.gov/coronavirus</a> will soon provide information instructing people in these groups on how to file a 2019 tax return with simple, but necessary, information including their filing status, number of dependents and direct deposit bank account information.</p>
				<b>I have not filed my tax return for 2018 or 2019. Can I still receive an economic impact payment?</b>
				<p>Yes. The IRS urges anyone with a tax filing obligation who has not yet filed a tax return for 2018 or 2019 to file as soon as they can to receive an economic impact payment. Taxpayers should include direct deposit banking information on the return.</p>
				<b>I need to file a tax return. How long are the economic impact payments available?</b>
				<p>For those concerned about visiting a tax professional or local community organization in person to get help with a tax return, these economic impact payments will be available throughout the rest of 2020.</p>
				<h2>3-30-20</h2>
				<p>The state of Illinois has extended the filing and payment deadline to July 15, 2020 for state taxes

				<h2>3-21-20</h2>
				<p>The volunteer appreciation lunch has been postponed.  We hope to reschedule this when possible.</p>
				<h2>3-20-20</h2>
				<p>The IRS has moved the tax filing and payment deadline to July 15, 2020.
				We are hopeful that we will be able to reopen some or all of our sites for
				at least a short period of time before the new filing deadline.</p>
				<h2>3-13-20</h2>
				<p>Effective immediately, all Bloomington/Normal VITA sites have suspended operations until further notice.</p>
