					<h2>6-15-20</h2>
					<p>At this time we are only able to reopen on an extremely limited basis.  We will be reaching out to clients that had a pre-existing appointment with us that was cancelled when we shutdown.  Additional details about how the appointment will work will be provided at that time.  Unfortunately, many different factors have led us to the conclusion that we will not be able to open to clients who did not have a prior appointment scheduled.</p>

					<h3>FAQs about the economic relief package</h3>
					<b>I have not filed my tax return for 2018 or 2019. Can I still receive an economic impact payment?</b>
					<p>Yes. The IRS urges anyone with a tax filing obligation who has not yet filed a tax return for 2018 or 2019 to file as soon as they can to receive an economic impact payment. Taxpayers should include direct deposit banking information on the return.</p>
					<b>I need to file a tax return. How long are the economic impact payments available?</b>
					<p>For those concerned about visiting a tax professional or local community organization in person to get help with a tax return, these economic impact payments will be available throughout the rest of 2020.</p>
					<h2>3-30-20</h2>
					<p>The state of Illinois has extended the filing and payment deadline to July 15, 2020 for state taxes

					<h2>3-20-20</h2>
					<p>The IRS has moved the tax filing and payment deadline to July 15, 2020.
					We are hopeful that we will be able to reopen some or all of our sites for
					at least a short period of time before the new filing deadline.</p>
