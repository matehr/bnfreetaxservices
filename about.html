			<h2>What services do we provide?</h2>
			<p>
				We work with families throughout McLean County Illinois and beyond, who meet current income guidelines, to prepare and e-file their federal and state income tax returns for free.  <b>There is never a charge for our services.</b>
			</p>
			<h2>How can we afford to do this for free?</h2>
			<p>
			   The Bloomington Normal VITA (Volunteer Income Tax Assistance) Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization.  We are run entirely by volunteers which keeps our expenses very low.  The expenses that we do have are covered through donations of funds and supplies.  We work with
			   the IRS and the state of Illinois to coordinate VITA sites and perform administrative functions.  As IRS approved VITA sites, tax returns will be prepared free of charge and without discrimination for clients meeting current income guidelines.  Clients
			   will not be asked to make any donations to the Foundation.
			</p>
			<h2 id="who_qualifies">What are the current income guidelines?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>If you are SINGLE with no dependents, your income should be $40,000 or less.</li>
					<li>If you are SINGLE WITH DEPENDENTS, your income should be $65,000 or less.</li>
					<li>If you are MARRIED, your combined income should be $65,000 or less.</li>
				</ul>
			<h2>How can I sign up to have my taxes prepared for me?</h2>
			<p>lAl of our sites are operating by drop-off appointment only.  Please visit our <a href="covid.html">Appointments</a> page for more information about how to book an appointment.</p>
			<!--<p>
				If you would like your taxes prepared at the Normal Activity Center, we ask that you make an appointment with us.  Information about appointments can be found on the Locations page.
				To have your taxes prepared at Bloomington Housing Authority or Heartland Community College, all you need to do is come in when our site is open, and bring all the materials from the required list below.  All clients are served on a first-come, first-served basis at these locations.
				February is our busiest month and sessions frequently fill up shortly after we open. Waiting times will be significantly less in March.
